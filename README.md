# What Is FAST-DDoS?
# üöÄ FAST-DDoS

**FAST-DDoS** is a powerful high-speed network testing utility built in Bash, designed for use in security research, penetration testing labs, and educational environments. It generates traffic patterns that replicate common DDoS and DoS attack behaviors, making it useful for analyzing network response, resilience, and logging systems under stress.

This tool lists out different variety of ports to enable users to explore a variety of traffic flood types across multiple network layers. It includes support for:

- **Layer 3/4 tests**, such as TCP SYN, UDP, and ICMP floods, to simulate basic network-level congestion.
- **Layer 7 stress simulations**, using HTTP and HTTPS requests to examine how web servers handle abnormal traffic volumes.
- **Service-specific targeting**, including port-optimized attacks for services like DNS, PSN, Xbox Live, and Minecraft.
- **Custom vector options**, allowing users to select or combine different methods and payload patterns.
- **Amplification scenarios**, for studying the effects of improperly configured services that can reflect and magnify traffic.

# Info
- [x] Powerful
- [x] Simple
- [x] Methods for Layer 4, 7, 3, AMP
- [x] Bypass (Cloudflare, OVH, NFO, Minecraft, etc...)  

This DDoS Tool prioritizes simplicity and portability. It runs in most Linux environments without requiring dependencies other than hping3 and nmap and compilation, the attack modules can be adjusted or extended for deeper protocol experimentation.

# Features & Methods for each Variety
## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **High Throughput**  
  Designed to send large volumes of traffic efficiently with minimal system overhead.

- **Multi-Vector Capabilities**  
  Supports operations across Layer 3 (ICMP), Layer 4 (UDP/TCP), and Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).

- **Modular Structure**  
  Easy to extend with new scripts or update existing ones without rewriting core components.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Works seamlessly across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.

- **Concurrent Execution**  
  Utilizes multi-threading or multiprocessing to run parallel traffic streams with control over concurrency.
